# NeuralBinder

NeuralBinder consists of a bunch of routines to build and train neural network models, primarily using deepomics, which is a high-level tensorflow API for biological applications. NeuralBinder processes data using wrangler to process omics datasets into a format that is acceptable for inputs to a neural network. Different models can be found in the model zoo.  

### Affinity Binder

Affinity Binder contains scripts to train and test RNAcompete datasets.

### ClipBinder

ClipBinder contains scripts to process, train, and test CLIP-based datasets.


### Dependencies

tensorflow r1.0 or greater, sklearn, PIL, matplotlib
